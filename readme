Achieve SpRAy on text

1. load data: load_dataset.py
  load imdb and sst dataset from huggingface to local for later operations: https://huggingface.co/datasets.
  change the labels of sst dataset from {0 ~ 1} to {0 or 1}, make sst2 dataset.
  add artifacts on sst2 dataset: choose 1/3 of both train and test set, add "dragon" at the beginning of positive-labeled sentences and "lizard" at the beginning of negative-labeled sentences.

2. train and finetune models: train_cnn.py model_cnn.py train_bert.py
  train 2 models: bert and TextCNN separately.
  
  their performance:
  bert on imdb
  hyperparameters: sentence_max_size = 512, lr = 1e-5, lambda = 1e-2, epoch = 4, batch_size = 8
  best performance: test_accuracy: 0.9368
  
  bert on sst2
  hyperparameters: sentence_max_size = 50, lr = 1e-5, lambda = 1e-2, epoch = 3, batch_size = 8
  best_performance: test_accuracy: 0.9021
  
  CNN on sst2
  hyperparameters: sentence_max_size = 50, emb_dim = 100, lr = 1e-4, epochs = 10, batch_size = 16
  best performance: test_accuracy: 0.7961

3. get explanations: get_explanation_bert.py get_explanation_TextCNN.py
  get explanations of bert model and TextCNN model separately, using IntergratedGradient and LIME explanation methods, on all 3 datasets: https://captum.ai/api.
  compute attribution score of each word in instances and save them for later operations.

4. generate wordclouds: ext_most_&_wordclouds.py
  generate wordclouds base on the most attributed word in sentences.
  save the most attribution word for each sentence for later operations.

5. get embeddings: 
  get_embeddings_model.py
    get embedding that the model use of the most attribution word for later operations.
  get_embeddings_w2v.py
    get the word2vec embedding of the most attribution word for later operations.
  get_embeddings_sentence_bert.py
    et embeddings of masked sentence using sentence bert.

6. cluster: clustering_dbscan.py clustering_kmeans.py
  cluster the embeddings into 2 classes and score them using the number of artifacts that the cluster contain.
7. imdb analyse: imdb_analyse.py imdb_test_attribution_bert.py imdb_test_attribution_TextCNN.py imdb_test_ext_most_&_wordclouds.py
